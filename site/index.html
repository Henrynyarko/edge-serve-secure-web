  <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
  <p>
    End users access the platform via a global HTTPS endpoint.
    Traffic is served through a CDN-enabled load balancer, which securely retrieves content
    from a private cloud storage bucket.

  <h2>Security Posture</h2>
  <p>
    The storage layer is not publicly accessible. Access is granted only through
    trusted infrastructure components. All traffic is encrypted in transit.
